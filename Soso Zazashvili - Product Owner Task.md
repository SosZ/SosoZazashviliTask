Task #1

“We need to generate a report about the clients transactions for the inspection institution”

Objective

Our goal is to create a feature, which will allow our clients to generate reports of their transactions, which will be fully adjustable with the

inspection institution.

Crossfunctional Team Management - Workflow

In order to prepare the documentation for the devs to work on, we need to arrange meetings and clarify things with:

**Teams**

**Reason**

Legal, Compliance and AML Teams

We need to talk about inspection institution topics with our legal team.

It is necessary to examine their approach to compliance terms.

We gather their approach and key points before generating the

necessary information for the Product brief.

Finance Team

It is critical to collect all of the points required for the inspection

institution reports. I'll contact our finance department and gather all of

the necessary information about the required data that will be

financially compliant for the inspection audits, etc.

I'll combine the information to fully customize user stories for our

developers.

Stakeholders and High Managers

be prioritized.
